## Welcome To My Profile!

Hello, I'm Noah, a Financial Analyst interested in data science and analytics.

### 🛠 Tools

### 💡 Projects
A project I enjoyed working on was building a [Bouldering Route Recommendation System](https://github.com/noahkims/Bouldering-Recommendation-System), using web scraping and TF-IDF and cosine similarity to provide recs for my next climbing trip to Joshua Tree.
